Project Title: MULTI FUNCTIONAL OPERATIONAL SUITE

DESCRIPTION :- 
This project is a suite of four distinct applications, each designed to solve a specific problem or perform a unique function.

1.Currency Converter (Using API)
This module allows users to convert between various currencies in real-time using an external API. Users can select their desired base currency and target currency, and the program will fetch the latest exchange rates from the API to calculate the converted value.

2. ATM Machine Simulation
This module simulates the basic functionality of an ATM machine. Users can perform operations such as withdrawing money, checking account balance, and depositing funds. It incorporates basic security checks and limits to simulate real-world banking scenarios.

3. Number Guessing Game
This is an interactive and fun game where users are challenged to guess a random number generated by the program within a certain range. The program provides hints (too high/too low) to guide the player.

4. Student Grade Management System
This module helps manage student information and calculates their grades. Users can input student data such as marks in different subjects, and the system will compute the total and average grades, as well as assign a grade based on predefined criteria.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:- 
Programming Language: Java (Enterprise edition and Standard edition).
API Link: https://www.frankfurter.app/
Data Storage: Simple file handling for storing ATM and Student Grade system data.
Libraries: Standard Java libraries and API connection handling.
